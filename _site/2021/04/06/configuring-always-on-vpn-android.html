<p><em>MY NOTE: The standard OpenVPN Connect app was buggy and didn’t stay AlwaysOn. Following an android update it was then unsupported. The open source app worked fine.</em></p>

<p>Install OpenVPN for Android</p>

<p>Please first install the open source app OpenVPN for Android by Arne Schwabe on Google Play.
