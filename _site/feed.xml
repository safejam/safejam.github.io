&lt;p&gt;With a browser, this is straightforward, it would pop-up asking for the credentials if it didn’t already have them, and the user would type them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A virtual private network (VPN) provides users with privacy and secure data when they browse the internet or engage in online activity. One of the most crucial elements of a VPN is the protocol that protects user anonymity from hackers, advertisement agencies and government entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protocol determines how the VPN will secure data in transit. Providers offer a wide range of protocols based on computer operating systems, devices, performance and other aspects. Below, we examine three of the most widely used protocols in the industry: OpenVPN, IKEv2 and L2TP. Which one is best? Let’s take a closer look.
Register Today! Secure Coding Virtual Summit
Join us on March 24, 2021, to hear from industry-leading AppSec and DevSecOps practitioners, analysts, and visionaries as they share their best pro tips and power ups to level up your code security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenVPN is the most popular and recommended protocol by VPN experts. OpenVPN is versatile and highly secure, making it a mainstay of the virtual private network industry. The VPN is aptly named open because it relies on open source technologies such as OpenSSL encryption library or SSL V3/TLS V1 protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an OpenVPN platform, providers maintain, update and assess the technology. One of the reasons why an OpenVPN is so effective is because it shields users who engage in online activity in plain sight. Users are less vulnerable to hackers and less likely to be detected by government agencies or aggressive marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this source, when data travels through the OpenVPN viewers cannot differentiate between an HTTPS and the SSL connection. The protocol can operate on any port while utilizing UDP or TCP protocols. This makes it easy for users to get around firewalls. Companies can utilize a wide range of strategies such as AES encryption, HMAC or OpenSLL when adding OpenVPN to their processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenVPNs require a third-party application because they are not supported by any platforms. Third-party providers such as iOS and Android, however, are supported. Although most companies offer customized OpenVPN configurations, they also allow users to personalize their own configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s summarize:
OpenVPN Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bypasses most firewalls.
Vetted by third parties.
Offers top-level security.
Works with multiple encryption methods.
Can be configured and customized to suit any preference.
Can bypass firewalls.
Supports a wide range of cryptic algorithms.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenVPN Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Highly technical and complex setup.
Relies upon third-party software.
Desktop-strong, but mobile can be weak.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEv2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEv2 was designed as a joint project between Cisco Systems and Microsoft. It operates as a true protocol and controls the IPSec key exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEv2 has the distinction of operating on non-mainstream platforms such as Linux, BlackBerry or other marginal platforms. However, it also comes with the Windows 7 operating system. Because of its ability to adapt, IKEv2 offers a consistent connection in various networks. So, if a connection drops, the IKEv2 helps the user maintain a VPN connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most protocols, IKEv2 meets user privacy demands. Since it offers support for MOBIKE, it can adapt to changes in any network. Therefore, if the user suddenly switches from a Wi-Fi connection to a data connection, IKEv2 can handle it flawlessly without losing the connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary:
IKEv2 Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Supports a wide range of encryption protocols.
Offers high-level stability and consistent connectivity.
Offers easy setup.
Super-fast VPN protocol.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEv2 Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Limited support for platforms.
Not immune to firewall blocks.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L2TP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable characteristic of L2TP is its inability to operate alone. To offer encryption or protection for data in transit, it must be paired with IPSec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L2TP is an extension of the PPTP protocol. It operates on a double encapsulation that includes a PPP connection on level one and an IPsec encryption on level two. While the L2TP protocol does support AES-256, stronger protocols can slow the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most desktop and mobile OSes contain L2TP, which makes implementation relatively simple. However, users and developers alike have noted that L2TP can be blocked by firewalls. What struggles it may have with firewalls, it more than makes up for in sender/receiver privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The L2TP design prevents hackers from viewing or intercepting data in transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the connection is secure, the protocol can be weak and slow. The connection can be hindered due to the traffic conversion into the L2TP format. Developers and users must also account for the additional layer of encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the summary:
L2TP Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Available on nearly all devices and operating systems.
Easy setup process.
High levels of security that display some weaknesses.
Multithreading improves performance.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L2TP Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Can be blocked by firewalls.
Performance can be blocked.
Double encapsulation can slow down performance.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which Protocol is Best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the different elements of each protocol and their varying application, the best protocol depends on the needs of the developer and the users. While the OpenVPN may be considered the go-to protocol, there are several factors to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenVPN is speedy, versatile and secure. It’s also compatible with any operating system both on-site and remote. Users that want a problem-free, high-performance protocol should probably stick with OpenVPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, however, that OpenVPNs requires a third-party. Developers that have an issue with this type of setup may want to turn to an L2TP or IKEv2. Some main considerations are security, speed, connectivity consistency and overall high performance. So, third-party support may not be high on the priority list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, how will the configuration with all platforms and devices affect the overall performance of the service and network? Developers need to ask these questions from their client’s perspective. Can a developer provide exceptional service with a VPN that doesn’t provide the absolute best security or super-fast speed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking everything into consideration, our belief is the OpenVPN is still the best protocol for all types of operating systems, devices and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">from https://securityboulevard.com/2019/03/openvpn-vs-ikev2-vs-l2tp-which-vpn-protocol-is-the-best/ A virtual private network (VPN) provides users with privacy and secure data when they browse the internet or engage in online activity.

Their stance that iOS devices are personal devices to be managed by the individual end users has led the way for the growth of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to aid in iOS management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many options to choose from, many MDM’s require costly subscription licenses and/or infrastructure considerations that may be out of reach for some organizations, including public education and SMBs. Luckily, Apple Configurator 2 (AC2) includes many of the necessary functionality to manage iOS at a higher level with its supervision mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with how this works, we’ll explore supervision, how it works, and how to configure devices for its use. But first, there are a few requirements necessary to make this work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple computer with macOS Mojave installed
Apple Configurator 2 (2.6 or later) installed
Internet access (Optional, but highly recommended to download applications)
iPad or iPhone device with iOS 12 (or later) installed
SEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is supervise mode?
Supervision was introduced in iOS 5 and has experienced many framework updates over the years as newer versions of iOS are introduced. While additional support for greater features continues to be included, the crux of supervise remains the same: To allow systems administrator’s greater control over iOS devices by securing and allowing the configuration of features and functions, allowing these devices (typically enterprise-owned) to be locked down to prevent unauthorized changes that could otherwise lead to device compromise, and by extension, compromise the data and/or business network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What features can be secured when a device is supervised?
This list of functions that are manageable are long–and continue to grow with the introduction of each new version of iOS. Among the more popular settings that admins can control include requiring passcodes for unlocking devices, setting minimum passcode lengths and complexity requirements, as well as timeouts and incorrect passcode lockouts, all of which protect data stored on devices from unauthorized access and data exfiltration in the event of loss or theft. Additional restrictions include setting profiles for corporate network and email access, company branding, and key escrow services that store a recovery key that may be used to bypass Activation Lock on iCloud-linked devices, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any requirements for a device to be supervised?
Any iOS device running iOS 5 (at least) is eligible for supervision. However, admins may wish to consult iOS release notes to verify that individual devices have the correct version of iOS installed so that support of required functions/features is adhered to. When supervising a device, ensure that existing data on the devices are backed-up since the supervision process erases all the data on the device and reinstalls (or upgrade) iOS, setting the foundation for the management platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring a device for supervision
Login to the Mac computer and launch the Apple Configurator 2 (AC2) app.
Connect the device(s) to be configured to the Mac using the USB cable.
In AC2, select the iOS device you wish to configure, then click on Actions | Prepare… to launch the wizard.
Since AC2 can be used to prepare devices for MDM use, we are prompted with the Configuration type on the first page of the wizard. For the purposes of this article and since we are not configuring the device for MDM management, select Manual from the drop-down menu, then click the Next button.
On the next page, you’ll be prompted to select the server to manage the device with post-AC2. Again, we will not be enrolling this device in an MDM, so we will select Do not enroll in MDM from the drop-down menu and click the Next button to proceed.
On the Supervise Devices page, you will be prompted to check the box next to Supervise devices, which enables supervision on that device. Additionally, if you wish to allow supervised devices to pair with their computers, check the box to allow that functionality. Otherwise, supervised devices will be disallowed from pairing with computers. Click the Next button to continue.
If you wish to enter information about the organization, you may do so on the following page. Enter the desired details and click the Next button.
When working with supervised devices, supervision identities are required. If setting up supervised devices for the first time, select the radio button next to Generate a New Supervision Identity to create a new one for your organization, then click Next to continue.
On the final page of the wizard, you will be prompted with choosing what options are presented to the end user during the Setup Assistant portion after the device is initialized. While optional, it is recommended that admins configure this portion by placing a check mark in the box next to each item you wish to allow the end user to configure–any boxes not checked will restrict end users from configuring those options during the Setup Assistant phase. Once these choices are configured, click the Prepare button to erase the device and reboot it in its newly supervised mode.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Apple’s stance on managing iOS devices at the enterprise level has often been met with minimal native support from the company themselves.

Apple computer with macOS Mojave installed Apple Configurator 2 (2.6 or later) installed Internet access (Optional, but highly recommended to download applications) iPad or iPhone device with iOS 12 (or later) installed SEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research) What is supervise mode? Supervision was introduced in iOS 5 and has experienced many framework updates over the years as newer versions of iOS are introduced. While additional support for greater features continues to be included, the crux of supervise remains the same: To allow systems administrator’s greater control over iOS devices by securing and allowing the configuration of features and functions, allowing these devices (typically enterprise-owned) to be locked down to prevent unauthorized changes that could otherwise lead to device compromise, and by extension, compromise the data and/or business network. What features can be secured when a device is supervised? This list of functions that are manageable are long–and continue to grow with the introduction of each new version of iOS. Among the more popular settings that admins can control include requiring passcodes for unlocking devices, setting minimum passcode lengths and complexity requirements, as well as timeouts and incorrect passcode lockouts, all of which protect data stored on devices from unauthorized access and data exfiltration in the event of loss or theft. Additional restrictions include setting profiles for corporate network and email access, company branding, and key escrow services that store a recovery key that may be used to bypass Activation Lock on iCloud-linked devices, for example. Are there any requirements for a device to be supervised? Any iOS device running iOS 5 (at least) is eligible for supervision. However, admins may wish to consult iOS release notes to verify that individual devices have the correct version of iOS installed so that support of required functions/features is adhered to. When supervising a device, ensure that existing data on the devices are backed-up since the supervision process erases all the data on the device and reinstalls (or upgrade) iOS, setting the foundation for the management platform. Configuring a device for supervision Login to the Mac computer and launch the Apple Configurator 2 (AC2) app. Connect the device(s) to be configured to the Mac using the USB cable. In AC2, select the iOS device you wish to configure, then click on Actions | Prepare… to launch the wizard. Since AC2 can be used to prepare devices for MDM use, we are prompted with the Configuration type on the first page of the wizard. For the purposes of this article and since we are not configuring the device for MDM management, select Manual from the drop-down menu, then click the Next button. On the next page, you’ll be prompted to select the server to manage the device with post-AC2. Again, we will not be enrolling this device in an MDM, so we will select Do not enroll in MDM from the drop-down menu and click the Next button to proceed. On the Supervise Devices page, you will be prompted to check the box next to Supervise devices, which enables supervision on that device. Additionally, if you wish to allow supervised devices to pair with their computers, check the box to allow that functionality. Otherwise, supervised devices will be disallowed from pairing with computers. Click the Next button to continue. If you wish to enter information about the organization, you may do so on the following page. Enter the desired details and click the Next button. When working with supervised devices, supervision identities are required. If setting up supervised devices for the first time, select the radio button next to Generate a New Supervision Identity to create a new one for your organization, then click Next to continue. On the final page of the wizard, you will be prompted with choosing what options are presented to the end user during the Setup Assistant portion after the device is initialized. While optional, it is recommended that admins configure this portion by placing a check mark in the box next to each item you wish to allow the end user to configure–any boxes not checked will restrict end users from configuring those options during the Setup Assistant phase. Once these choices are configured, click the Prepare button to erase the device and reboot it in its newly supervised mode.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Supervise Ios Devices Without Data Loss</title><link href="https://blog.mysafeinternet.com/2021/04/06/supervise-ios-devices-without-data-loss.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Supervise Ios Devices Without Data Loss" /><published>2021-04-06T16:31:29+01:00</published><updated>2021-04-06T16:31:29+01:00</updated><id>https://blog.mysafeinternet.com/2021/04/06/supervise-ios-devices-without-data-loss</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.mysafeinternet.com/2021/04/06/supervise-ios-devices-without-data-loss.html">&lt;p&gt;Supervise iOS Devices without Data Loss (Backup &amp;amp; Supervise)
If you are planning on supervising existing iOS devices that are in field then one of the challenges is to retain the data that is already present in the iOS device. A normal backup and restore on the iOS device causes the Supervision settings to be lost and the device becomes unmanaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some special steps required to backup and restore while supervising the device. This document outlines the steps to backup the iOS device that you want to supervise and then restore it before supervising it and hence avoid Data Loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites
Target iOS Device (e.g Device A): This is the iOS device that you want to Supervise and enroll in Scalefusion.
Temporary iOS Device (e.g Device B): You would need an additional iOS device that will act as a temporary device to hold the backup.
The OS version of Device A and Device B should be exactly same, i.e, if Device A is on 13.3 then you would need the Device B to be on 13.3
macOS Machine: You would need one MacBook to take the backups and restore
Apple Configurator 2 (AC2): Download and install the latest version of AC2 on the MacBook.
Lightning Cable
Step 1: Backup Target Device - Device A
The first step is to take a back up of the target device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect the Device A to the MacBook and Open Finder App, In Finder app under locations you will see the iOS Devices. When prompted accept the Trust prompts that will be shown on the MacBook and iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once trusted the device details of the connected iOS device will be shown. In Device details, click General &amp;gt; Backup Now
The Backup may also start automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the backup is complete note down the timestamp that will be used in next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Restore the Backup to Temporary Device - Device B
In this step we will restore the backup of the target device to the temporary device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now connect the temporary device i.e Device B to the MacBook. Open the Finder App and accept the Trust prompts.
Under Device details, Click General &amp;gt; Restore Backup… .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the list of backups, select the backup that you took in Step 1.
You can identify the backup using the timestamp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will restore the backup of Device A to Device B
Step 3: Backup Temporary Device - Device B
Now that the Device B has the restored data from Device A, it is time to back up the Device B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect the Device B to the MacBook if not connected already. Open the Finder App and accept the Trust prompts.
Under Device details, Click General &amp;gt; Back Up Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait for the Backup to be complete. Note down the timestamp of the backup.
Step 4: Restoring the Data and Supervising Target Device - Device A
This is the final step that involves a multi-step process whereby we restore the data and Supervise Device A simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect the Device A to the MacBook. Open the Finder App and click on the connected iOS device.
Under Device details, Click General &amp;gt; Restore Backup… . From the list of backups, select the backup that you took at Step 3 i.e Backup of Device B
You can identify the backup using the timestamp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Device A will now show a message, Restore In Progress and will turn off and reboot to the Hello screen. DONOT perform any action on the device once it reaches the Hello screen.
At this point open Apple Configurator 2 which will display the connected device.
Right/Secondary click on the device frame that you see in AC2 to see the menu options.
Select Prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see a screen with the following options, make sure you have selected the following options,
From the Prepare With dropdown, select Manual Configuration.
Un-select/Uncheck Add to Device Enrollment Program.
Select/Check Supervise Devices.
Select/Check Allow Devices to Pair with other computers.
Uncheck Enable Shared iPad.
Click Next&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this screen when prompted for a Server, select Do not enroll in MDM. Click Next&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select an Organization and click Next
Select the iOS Setup Assistant options to Skip or show. Click Prepare to start the supervision process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supervision process will start and once the Supervision is complete you can Enroll the device using QR Code.&lt;/p&gt;

Allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks = Yes

The reason we allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks is so the kids can connect to guest Wi-Fi solutions at Starbucks, McDonalds etc.

In the business world, this is sometimes not allowed in case someone sets up a fake hotspot to capture logon information.

If your kids have an unlimited data plan on their mobiles or you're happy to top up their credit when needed, then you can leave this box checked for maximum security.

&lt;p&gt;Used previous ami called  ‘proxy - internal’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added ‘acl all src 0.0.0.0/0’ to /etc/squid3/squid.conf to allow access from anywhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added ‘http_access allow all’ (instead of http_access allow localnet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHANGED VPC DHCP OPTIONS BACK TO AMAZON-PROVIDED DNS (could not resolve names with remote-browser DCs switched off)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created new DHCP options for CloudFlare’s 1.1.1.1 service but used 1.1.1.3 &amp;amp; 1.0.0.3 which includes protection from malware and adult sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudo apt-get install apache2-utils (required for digest authentication)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cd /etc/squid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudo touch passwd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the owner and restricting access isn’t strictly required, but it’s good practice since the file’s contents will contain unsalted MD5-hashed passwords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# chown proxy.proxy passwd
# chmod 640 passwd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realm=mysafeinternet
Username=adam
Password=mysafeinternet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudo htdigest /etc/squid/passwd mysafeinternet adam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Using password ‘mysafeinternet’&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test authentication with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/usr/lib/squid3/digest_file_auth - c /etc/squid/passwd
Type
“adam”:”mysafeinternet”
The hash is returned successfully&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-squidconf&quot;&gt;Update squid.conf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removed all the acls for safe ports etc just to focus on the auth_users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;auth_param digest program /usr/lib/squid3/digest_file_auth -c /etc/squid/passwd
