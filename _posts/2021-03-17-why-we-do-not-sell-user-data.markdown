## Privacy matters

SafeJAM Ltd, operating as MySafeInternet, will not sell, share, rent or give away any of your personal information without your consent. We operate out of the European Union, respect their privacy values and abide by the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

## It's not our data

Our business is built on the trust you put into our service, to protect you, your family, and your loved ones. 

We only have a legitimate interest in the minimum amount of configuration information (i.e. your settings) needed to make our service operational for you.

Your data remains yours and we have zero interest in intercepting any internet traffic or tracking user activity across the MySafeInternet service. That's your data, not ours.
