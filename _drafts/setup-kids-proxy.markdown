Global HTTP Proxy
Proxy Type = Manual
Proxy Server and Port = DNS Name of your instance or provided by MySafeInternet service
User Name & Password = <blank> (Access to the proxy server will be secured by source UP address)
Allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks = Yes

The reason we allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks is so the kids can connect to guest Wi-Fi solutions at Starbucks, McDonalds etc.

In the business world, this is sometimes not allowed in case someone sets up a fake hotspot to capture logon information.

If your kids have an unlimited data plan on their mobiles or you're happy to top up their credit when needed, then you can leave this box checked for maximum security.
