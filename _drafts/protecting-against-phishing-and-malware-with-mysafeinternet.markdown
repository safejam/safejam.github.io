Due to Coronovirus, many more people are working, socialising and gaming online than ever before.

Unfortunately this means that there are many more people for hackers to target with their scams. These include:

1. Email and web site scams (Phishing)

2. Deploying malware, including ransomware

    After you are tricked into sharing your username and password or unintentionally install some code, hackers can gain access to your computer, devices, or online accounts and access your money and personal information.

If the big, bad internet is not for you, or you would like to protect your loved ones, then consider limiting your exposure to hackers by using a service such as MySafeInternet.com.
